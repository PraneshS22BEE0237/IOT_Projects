# Automatic Water Level Controller

An Arduino-based automatic water level monitoring and control system designed to maintain optimal water levels in tanks or reservoirs. This project features real-time water level measurement, automatic pump control, manual override capabilities, and a user-friendly LCD display interface.


## üîç Overview

This Automatic Water Level Controller is an IoT-based solution that monitors water levels using an ultrasonic sensor and automatically controls a water pump to maintain desired water levels. The system includes both automatic and manual operation modes, making it suitable for various applications such as water tanks, overhead tanks, and irrigation systems.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Water Level Monitoring**: Uses HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for accurate distance measurement
- **Automatic Pump Control**: Automatically turns pump ON when water level drops below 30% and OFF when tank is full (99%)
- **Manual Override**: Switch between automatic and manual modes
- **LCD Display**: 16x2 LCD shows water level percentage and pump status
- **EEPROM Storage**: Stores calibration settings permanently
- **Manual Calibration**: Set reference water level using push button
- **Visual Indicators**: LED indicators for system status
- **Relay Control**: Safe pump control using relay module
