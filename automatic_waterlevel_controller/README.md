- **Manual Override**: Switch between automatic and manual modes
- **LCD Display**: 16x2 LCD shows water level percentage and pump status
- **EEPROM Storage**: Stores calibration settings permanently
- **Manual Calibration**: Set reference water level using push button
- **Visual Indicators**: LED indicators for system status
- **Relay Control**: Safe pump control using relay module

## üíª Software Features

### Core Functions:
- **Water Level Calculation**: Converts ultrasonic sensor readings to percentage
- **Automatic Control Logic**: Maintains water level between 30% and 99%
- **Mode Switching**: Toggle between automatic and manual operation
- **Calibration System**: Set reference point for accurate measurements
- **EEPROM Storage**: Persistent storage of calibration data
- **Real-time Display**: Continuous monitoring and status updates

### Control Logic:
```
IF water_level < 30% AND auto_mode = ON
    THEN pump = ON
IF water_level > 99%
    THEN pump = OFF
```

## üöÄ Installation

### Hardware Setup:
1. Connect the components according to the circuit diagram
2. Ensure proper power supply connections
3. Mount the ultrasonic sensor at the top of the water tank
4. Install the relay and pump connections safely

### Software Setup:
1. Install Arduino IDE
2. Install required library:
   ```
   LiquidCrystal (usually pre-installed)
   ```
3. Upload the `sketch.ino` code to Arduino Uno
4. Power up the system

## üìñ Usage

### Initial Setup:
1. Power on the system
2. The LCD will display "WATER LEVEL: 0%" and "PUMP:OFF MANUAL"
3. Fill the tank to desired maximum level
4. Switch to AUTO mode using the slide switch
5. Press and hold the calibration button to set reference level
6. The system will store this as 100% level in EEPROM

### Operation Modes:

**Automatic Mode:**
- Switch slide switch to AUTO position
- System automatically controls pump based on water level
- Pump turns ON when level drops below 30%
- Pump turns OFF when level reaches 99%

**Manual Mode:**
- Switch slide switch to MANUAL position
- Use push button to manually toggle pump ON/OFF
- Useful for maintenance or emergency situations

### Display Information:
- **Top Line**: "WATER LEVEL: XX%" - Current water level percentage
- **Bottom Line**: "PUMP:ON/OFF AUTO/MANUAL" - Pump status and operation mode

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Water Level Measurement**:
   - HC-SR04 sensor measures distance to water surface
   - Distance is converted to water level percentage using calibrated reference
   - Percentage = (reference_level - current_distance) √ó 100 / reference_level

2. **Automatic Control**:
   - System monitors water level continuously
   - When level drops below 30%, pump activates
   - When level reaches 99%, pump deactivates
   - Prevents dry running and overflow

3. **Manual Override**:
   - Switch to manual mode for direct control
   - Push button toggles pump state
   - Useful for testing and maintenance

4. **Data Storage**:
   - EEPROM stores calibration data permanently
   - Settings retained even after power loss
   - Maximum value limited to 150 for safety

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**LCD Display Not Working:**
- Check all LCD connections
- Adjust contrast using potentiometer
- Verify 5V power supply

**Inaccurate Water Level Readings:**
- Recalibrate the system
- Check ultrasonic sensor mounting
- Ensure sensor is not obstructed

**Pump Not Responding:**
- Check relay connections
- Verify pump power supply
- Test in manual mode first

**System Not Remembering Settings:**
- Check EEPROM write operations
- Verify calibration procedure
- Reset and recalibrate if needed

### Calibration Tips:
- Ensure tank is at desired maximum level during calibration
- Hold calibration button until LCD updates
- Recalibrate if readings seem inaccurate
- Maximum calibration value is limited to 150 inches for safety
